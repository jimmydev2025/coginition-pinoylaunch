                    color palette with one dominant hue. Utilizing advanced color mapping algorithms and
                    adaptive color blending techniques, the module enables the Android to access a broader
                    range of colors and rare palettes, allowing for increased diversity in its artwork.

                    Post Processors hold the knowledge of hundreds of years of fast painting techniques.
                    It allows you to reduce the number of days required to draw an artwork. Initially,
                    it takes 7 days for the first generation and more for the next ones, but using the
                    module can reduce this number.

                        Each module upgrade reduces the base deadline for painting (7 days) by 1 day.
                        Resulting in the fastest first generation with 4 upgrades (only for Nicole) reduced to only 3 days,
                        and the 5th generation in the same example would be 6 days instead of 14 days without any upgrades.

                        It is important to remember that each next generation is slower due to Android features,
                        so the sooner you apply the Processors module, the more paintings you will be able to get.
