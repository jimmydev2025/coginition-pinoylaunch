                Misu is a Japanese corporation rumored to be controlled by the Yakuza families.
                The company grew out of a government project for combat androids, but after the collapse of the State,
                the project was bought for next to nothing by a private company and was reorganized a few years later to suit the production of A.C.I.A.

                Due to the preservation of the company&apos;s traditions and most of the team,
                Misu androids are made in an aggressively militaristic style, and some modules were originally intended for combat purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Misu&apos;s vast influence and corporate policy allowed it to quickly capture the local market and eliminate
                three small competing companies early on. The fate of these companies&apos; developers remains unknown.
            </p>
            <p>
                Misu emphasizes the power and efficiency of androids, but they have low mobility
                and are not very practical. Black is the main color of these robots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both the full history of the company and its technologies are shrouded in secrecy and are completely classified.
                To avoid any information leaks, the company hires no more than five employees per year. Each employee must pass
                through 5 to 8 security levels, depending on their position, to reach their workplace.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a long time, the corporation has been producing stationary models that require high power.
                Nicole is the second generation of Misu androids. The first was Aron, but its excessive massiveness and overly
                aggressive appearance caused a negative reaction from the audience and forced the company to reconsider its approach to creating androids.

                Although the purpose of Misu androids has
                evolved over time
                , the company&apos;s commitment to
                a militaristic
                style is

                Founded in 2038, the company traces its roots to a groundbreaking research project that studied
                task optimization using the human brain as a model. This research uncovered the potential to apply
                similar processes to the development of artificial intelligence for androids. The compelling nature of

                Roman retains its efficiency longer than all other A.C.I.A robots
                and does not need specific maintenance. Androids of all manufacturers
                create each subsequent picture slower than the previous one, and Roman is no exception.
                But while any other robot creates the fifth picture in 14 days, Roman will only spend 10 days on it.

                Admiring the unusual design and exclusive materials of the Kira android,
                fans of the brand always note the &quot;alien&quot; appearance of this model.
                This is exactly the effect that the founder of the Kermêsse brand aspired to, speaking of androids as works of art.

            <p>
                The exclusivity of these android artists - 520 models in the entire universe — is explained not only by
                their unique appearance and luxury. Their biggest feature is the latest development of the
                Kermêsse company – &quot;Deep Immersion&quot;, thanks to which the android can create animated pictures
                with an immersive effect.

                In the process of drawing, all androids dream, but only Kira is able to extract
                various images and plots from her subconscious, turning them into unusual abstract animations called &quot;Dreams&quot;.

                The viewer plunges into the depths of the picture and gets into a realistic world inside the image.
                There may be the most bizarre creatures and the most unexpected environments. As you go deeper into
                the picture, the plot may change, and objects may approach you or move away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Biologists and neurophysiologists intend to use the technology of dream extraction in their field of
                work
                due to its similarity with many processes happening inside a human brain. According to scientists, they
                expect a significant breakthrough in their work, because now they have the opportunity to build various
                simulation models and perform calculations that were previously impossible.
